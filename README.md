### Summary

**1. User Engagement Pattern Discovery and Visualization:**
- **Objective:** Discover and visualize user engagement patterns using association rule mining.
- **Steps:**
  1. **Data Preparation:** Load, clean, and transform data into a suitable format.
  2. **Pattern Analysis:** Create a binary matrix, identify frequent itemsets with the Apriori algorithm, and generate association rules.
  3. **Visualization:** Construct and customize a network graph to represent rules and their relationships based on lift values.
- **Outputs:** 
  - **Data Files:** `ugc_data_melted.xlsx` (cleaned data), `frequent_itemsets_and_association_rules.xlsx` (frequent itemsets and rules).
  - **Visualization:** `user_engagement_model.pdf` (network graph of user engagement patterns).

**2. Jaccard Similarity Valuation:**
- **Objective:** Compare association rules from training and testing datasets.
- **Steps:**
  1. **Library Imports:** Load necessary libraries.
  2. **Data Loading and Preparation:** Split data into training (70%) and testing (30%), preprocess, and apply the Apriori algorithm.
  3. **Rule Comparison:** Identify and count common rules, calculate Jaccard Similarity.
  4. **Saving Results:** Save frequent itemsets and rules for both datasets.
- **Outputs:** Detailed files on itemsets and rules, and Jaccard Similarity measure.

**3. Evaluation Report:**
- **Objective:** Analyze and visualize the overlap of association rules between training and testing datasets.
- **Steps:**
  1. **Count Rules:** Calculate common, unique training, and unique testing rules.
  2. **Calculate Jaccard Similarity:** Measure similarity between rule sets.
  3. **Identify Unique Rules:** Determine rules unique to each dataset.
  4. **Plotting:** Create a bar plot showing rule counts and Jaccard Similarity.
  5. **Results Display:** Print counts, similarity score, and detailed rule sets.
- **Outputs:** Bar plot of rule comparison, printed counts and similarity score.
